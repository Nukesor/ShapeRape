# ShapeRape

A fast-paced action arcade game.

Push your fingers to the limits! Try to collect as many shapes as possible while your time is constantly running out!

This game has been made during the Global Gamejam 2014. Check out the official [website](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/shaperape)

## Technology Notes 

We are using löve (http://www.love2d.org), a lua game library, together with the lovetoys (https://github.com/Nukesor/lua-lovetoys) library that provides an Entity System.  

## Installation

1. To run from source install love2d (a lua game library)
2. Run `git submodule update --init` to get the entity system
3. `make run`.  

Note: Right now there is only unix support for development.
