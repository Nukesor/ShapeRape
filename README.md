# ShapeRape

A fast-paced action arcade game.

Push your fingers to the limits! Try to collect as many shapes as possible while your time is constantly running out!

## Technology Notes: 

We are using löve (http://www.love2d.org), a lua game library, together with the lovetoys (https://github.com/Nukesor/lua-lovetoys) library that provides an Entity System.  
To run from source (only unix supported for development right now) install love2d (a lua game library), then run `make run`.  
Don't foget to run `git submodule update --init` to get the entity system. The game won't work otherwise.
